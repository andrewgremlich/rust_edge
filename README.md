# RUST EDGE

A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) port of my [SNOW EDGE](https://github.com/andrewgremlich/snow-edge) terminal-like game.

## play game

In order to run the game you may either clone this repository or download the binary in the releases.

### cloning repository

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Clone repo with this command `git clone https://github.com/andrewgremlich/rust_edge.git`.

Go to the project folder in the terminal and run `cargo run [easy, medium, hard]`.

### download binary

Download the binary from the [repository releases tab](https://github.com/andrewgremlich/rust_edge/releases).

The binary will need to have permissions changed.

`chmod 744 rust_edge` for read, write, and execute permissions for the user.

Your operating system might not allow the binary to run, being downloaded from github. For MacOS and once you run the game once, the game will be blocked, Just go to security settings and there should be a little detail that says something along the lines "rust_edge has been blocked". Click allow anyway.

## intention

This project has the intention to be my playground for learning Rust. So that could mean this little project actually becomes something, or it could not. just depends on how much I invest into this project to learn Rust.
