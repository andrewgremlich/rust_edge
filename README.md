# RUST EDGE

A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) port of my [SNOW EDGE](https://github.com/andrewgremlich/snow-edge) terminal-like game.

## Notes

-   Maybe use TUI_RS? https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs
-   Another one... https://github.com/gyscos/Cursive
-   and another one...https://github.com/redox-os/termion
-   They are all pretty even.
